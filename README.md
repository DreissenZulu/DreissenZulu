# Homework Assignment Unit 1: Portfolio Page

## Description

This assignment is the starting point for my portfolio and about page, where I will showcase my projects and skills to potential employers through a clean and interesting page

## Installation

To use the webpages, all files in the repo folder, including the assets, css, and images folders must be pushed to GitHub, where you can access all the pages in a web environment.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was setting up the CSS file of the inital index webpage. I found that the best start was to start from scratch, deleting the example formatting we did in class. I began with the sticky footer, using the flexbox method. I found that my footer wasn't touching the very bottom of the page, but I later discovered that this was because I used a paragraph tag in my footer, which affected the style formatting.

Another major challenge was creating a header which matched the example image. I found that the best way to do this was to have a header tag fill the width of the webpage, then use another tag to constrict the other elements to the 960px width.

Adjusting the width of certain elements was necessary, as adding padding prevented them from appearing centered in the main body. This was easily resolved with a little basic math.
